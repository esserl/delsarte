# Computing the Picard number of weighted Delsarte surfaces

The function "DelsartePicard" computes the Picard number of a well-formed, klt, Delsarte surface inside of weighted projective space.  This implements an extension of an algorithm of Shioda, by expressing a given Delsarte surface as a quotient of a Fermat surface.  The program assumes the input is well-formed and klt.

The companion function "matrix_potentials" can be used to generate quasismooth Delsarte equations matching a given degree and weights.
